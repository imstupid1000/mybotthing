# About Automatic
Automatic is a multi-purpose bot. It has a lot of random commands. That's basically it.

# Fun Commands
(note: this list of commands may not change as more commands are added.) coinflip: Literally just flips a coin. roll: This command rolls a die. Add a number after the command to change how many sides the die has. pfp: Mention a user to get a link to their discord profile picture/avatar. Your pfp/avatar is shown if no user is mentioned.

# Photos
cat: Just shows a random image of a cat. dog: Would show random image of a dog, but this command doesn't work atm.

# Tools
kick: Kicks a mentioned user. Duh. modmail: Send a message to the owner of Automatic. Type your message after the command. serverinfo: Shows info about current server. Again, duh.

# That's it.
Automatic will need admin permissions to perform certain tasks. When messages are deleted, or a user joins the server Automatic will send a message in #logs. Automatic creates a channel called logs if one doesn't exist. (May change in futute) Automatic will give new users a role called Member. Default color is green. (May also be changeable is future)
